Issues:

In both D-summary and E-alpha there is an UTF-8 encoding issue 
where special characters are being encoded wrong. See
http://www.i18nqa.com/debug/utf8-debug.html. The "Expected"
column is the character we expect to get from our query and 
the "Actual" is what we are actually getting for those 
characters.
